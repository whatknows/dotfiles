# Bootstrap script for setting up a new OSX machine
#
# This script includes the following steps:
# 1. Install Xcode
# 2. Install Homebrew
# 3. Install OS level packages
# 4. Install software via Cask
#
# This should be idempotent so it can be run multiple times.
#
# Some apps don't have a cask and so still need to be installed by hand. These
# include:
#
# @TODO: List apps you care about here.
#
# Notes:
#
# - If installing full Xcode, it's better to install that first from the app
#   store before running the bootstrap script. Otherwise, Homebrew can't access
#   the Xcode libraries as the agreement hasn't been accepted yet.
